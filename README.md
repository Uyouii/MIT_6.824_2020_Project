# MIT 6.824 2020

This Project includes the Lec record and Lab implementation for [6.824 Schedule: Spring 2020](http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2020/schedule.html) .

The MIT 6.824 is a very amazing course, even after working for five years, a lot of content is still worth learning.

I change the project implementation to go 1.17 (the original project on the website is for go 1.13).

The directory of this repositories:

- [project](https://github.com/Uyouii/MIT_6.824_2020_Project/tree/master/project): project is for the lab and code
- [tutorial](https://github.com/Uyouii/MIT_6.824_2020_Project/tree/master/tutorial/): tutorial record the leasons file and notes.

## Lab 1  MapReduce

change the test-mr.sh and file location to adapt to go1.17

run test:

```sh
cd project/src/test
./test-mr.sh

some out:
*** Starting wc test.
--- wc test: PASS
*** Starting indexer test.
--- indexer test: PASS
*** Starting map parallelism test.
--- map parallelism test: PASS
*** Starting reduce parallelism test.
--- reduce parallelism test: PASS
